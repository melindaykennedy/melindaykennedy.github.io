                        HI!
                        Our names are Thunder and Lightning. We are 2 month old husky puppies. Our foster mom says we are sweet little boys
                         and that we are good at making her laugh. We are smart boys and love playing with our sister and 4 legged foster
                        siblings. I really love my foster mom but my 2-legged foster siblings are really the loves of my life.
                        We are up to date on shots, spayed and microchipped. We come with a free wellness visit and 30 days free
                        insurance as well. If you are interested in adopting me, please send an email or adption application
                        to adoptions@adoptmeplz.org.Love and kisses,Thunder and Lightning
