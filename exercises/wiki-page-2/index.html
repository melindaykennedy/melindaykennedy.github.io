            and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools,
            where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.
        </p>

        <p>
            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message.
            They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the
            aesthetics of typography and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas,
            feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand,
            a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design
            transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.[7]
        </p>

        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system.
            For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the aviation world[8] or space
            exploration.[9][10] In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production
            of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and
            classes where it can be applied.
        </p>

        <p>
            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,[11] graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of
            rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. From
            there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in the 19th century[12] and
            its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange
            today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the development of new
            technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who develop them.[13]

        <h3>Terminology</h3>

        <hr>

        <p>
            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although
            it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San
            Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:[15]
        </p>
    
        <h4>An Enterprising Trades Union</h4>

        <p>
            ...The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among printers is an assurance that with the elemental
            principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic
            design and decorating...
        </p>

        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917â€“1918 course catalog of the California School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course titled
            Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught
            by Frederick Meyer.[16]

            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21s
            centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share
            many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client.
            In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence
            is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human
            experience."[17]

        <h4><b>Nineteenth Century</b></h4>

        <p>
            In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design education in Great Britain, informing the government
            of the importance of design in his <i>Journal of Design and Manufactures</i>. He organized the Great Exhibition as a
            celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.
        </p>

        <p>
            From 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press was a leader in graphic design associated with the Arts and
            Crafts movement, creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,[21] in addition to wallpaper
            and textile designs.[22] Morris' work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly influenced
            Art Nouveau.[23]
        </p>

        <p>
            Will H. Bradley became one of the notable graphic designers in the late nineteenth-century due to creating
            art pieces in various Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs as promotions for a literary
            magazine titled The Chap-Book.[24]
