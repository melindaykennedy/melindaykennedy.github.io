            and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools,
            where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.
        </p>
        <p>
            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message.
            They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the
            aesthetics of typography and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas,
            feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand,
            a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design
            transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.[7]
        </p>
        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system.
            For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the aviation world[8] or space
            exploration.[9][10] In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production
            of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and
            classes where it can be applied.

        <p>
            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,[11] graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of
            rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. From
            there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in the 19th century[12] and
            its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange
            today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the development of new
            technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who develop them.[13]
