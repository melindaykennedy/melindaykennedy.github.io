                <h2>2 Pagan Goddesses to Work With</h2>
                <h4>by Melinda Kennedy * November 3, 2023</h4>
                <h3>Hecate</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most worshiped and accessible ancient Greek
                    Goddesses is Hecate, who is heralded as “Queen of the
                    Witches.” She is thought to have originated in Egypt
                    as the Goddess Heqet, a popular Goddess who rules magick
                    and fertility. As she is a powerful sorceress, she helps
                    all witches who contact her manifest their dreams, become
                    confident in their spellwork, and be supportive of one
                    another with their magickal talents. She is a Goddess who
                    encourages you to take matters into your own hands and use
                    your tools to affect change in your community and protect
                    yourself. If you are interested in sorcery, spell work,
                    esoteric studies, and helping others with your magick,
                    Hecate is the perfect Goddess to begin your journey with!
                    Like her mother Nyx, Hecate is associated with the Triple
                    Goddess Symbol. However, she is often associated with the
                    Maiden phase of the Maiden, Mother, and Crone. If the 
                    following signs appear to you, Hecate may be initiating
                    you into her craft:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ravens</li>
                    <li>Black dogs</li>
                    <li>Black Cats</li>
                    <li>The Moon</li>
                    <li>Torches</li>
                    <li>Bonfires</li>
                    <li>Matches</li>
                    <li>The Triple Goddess Symbol</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Nyx</h3>
                <p>
                    Mother of Hecate and primordial Greek Goddess of the Night,
                    Nyx is another beloved Goddess who is protective and
                    encouraging. As she is believed to have mothered over
                    1,000 deities and taken several lovers.. A maternal role
                    is one you can expect when you accept her nurturing and
                    fiercely protective energy into your life. As she created
                    affection, magick, sleep, death, and much more, her powers
                    are expansive. However, she is most recognized for her
                    psychic abilities and can help her followers grow in their
                    divination practices. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nyx was so protective of her gifts that she stayed in a
                    shielded cave in Tartarus, the depths of the underworld.
                    Only those dedicated enough to embark on a treacherous
                    journey to her cavern could receive her wisdom. This speaks
                    to her nature as a matron deity– if you don’t heed her
                    advice with care, you may be subject to psychic chaos!
                    She is a tough matron, but can help you increase your
                    confidence, beauty, sensuality, psychic abilities.
                    She will also encourage your protection spells,
                    such as banishing, revenge, and psychic shielding rituals.
                    Represented by the Triple Goddess, Nyx embodies all phases
                    of womanhood but is most often depicted in her role as the
                    mother. The following correspondences may be a sign that
                    Nyx is offering her Divine wisdom to you:
