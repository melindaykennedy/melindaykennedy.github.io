            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also
            <i>canopy disengagement</i>,
            <sup>[1]</sup>
            <i>canopy shyness</i>,
            <sup>[2]</sup> or
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i>
            <sup>[3]</sup>) is
            a feature observed in some tree species, in
            which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not 
            touch each other, instead forming a canopy with 
            channel-like gaps.
            <sup>[4][5]</sup> This is most prevalent
            among trees of the same species, but also occurs
            between trees of different species.
            <sup>[6][7]</sup>
            There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is
            an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that
            it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness
            is uncertain.<sup>[6]</sup> It has been discussed in scientific
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses
            and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple
            mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent
            evolution.[citation needed]
        </p>

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas
            suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during <b>winds</b>.
            The abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. Studies
            suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours
            until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns are 
            artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill 
            the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown shyness
            between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that
            shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning,
            including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession
            forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.
            <sup>[6][12]</sup>. According to this theory, variable flexibility in
            lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
        </p>

            Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth nodules
            disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with lateral growth.
            Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who studied the crown shyness patterns in
            <b>eucalyptus</b> in 1955, believed that the trees' growing tips were sensitive to
            abrasion, resulting in canopy gaps.<sup>[13]</sup> Miguel Franco (1986) 
            observed that the branches of <b><i>Picea sitchensis</i></b> (Sitka spruce) and 
            <b><i>Larix kaempferi</i></b> (Japanese larch) suffered physical damage due to
            abrasion, which killed the leading shoots.<sup>[14][15]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutual light sensing
            by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated <b>shade avoidance</b> response is a
            well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species.<sup>[16]</sup> Neighbor detection
            is thought to be a function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants can sense
            the proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered <b>far-red</b> light, a task
            widely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the <b>phytochrome</b>
            photoreceptors.<sup>[17]</sup> Many species of plant respond to an increase in far-red
            light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from
            the far-red stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation.<sup>[18]</sup> Similarly,
            plants use blue light to induce the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a
            role in the recognition of neighboring plants,<sup>[19]</sup> though this was just starting
            to be recognised in 1988.<sup>[20]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The characterization of these behaviors might suggest that crown shyness is simply
            the result of mutual shading based on well-understood shade avoidance responses.<sup>[6]
            [21]</sup> Malaysian scholar <b>Francis S.P. Ng</b>, who studied <b><i>Dryobalanops aromatica</i></b>,
            suggested that the growing tips were sensitive to light levels and stopped growing
            when nearing the adjacent foliage due to the induced shade.<sup>[6][21]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            A 2015 study has suggested that <b><i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i></b>shows different leaf
            placement strategies when grown amongst kin and unrelated conspecifics,
            shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding kin. This response was shown to
            be contingent on the proper functioning of multiple photosensory modalities.<sup>
            [22]</sup> A 1998 study proposed similar systems of photoreceptor-mediated
            inhibition of growth as explanations of crown shyness,<sup>[6][21]</sup> though a
            causal link between photoreceptors and crown asymmetry had yet to be
            experimentally proven. This might explain instances of intercrown spacing
            that are only exhibited between conspecifics.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
