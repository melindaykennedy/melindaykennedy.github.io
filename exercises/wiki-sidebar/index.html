                    Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was
                    the 37th president of the United States, serving from 1969
                    to 1974. A lawyer and member of the Republican Party, he
                    previously served as a representative and senator from
                    California and was the 36th vice president from 1953 to 1961
                    under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His five years in the
                    White House saw reduction of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam
                    War, détente with the Soviet Union and China, the Apollo 11
                    Moon landing, and the establishment of the Environmental
                    Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health
                    Administration. Nixon's second term ended early when he
                    became the only U.S. president to resign from office, as a
                    result of the Watergate scandal.
