            <h1>Richard Nixon</h1>
                <p>
                    Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 - April 22, 1994) was
                    the 37th president of the United States, serving from 1969 to
                    1974. A lawyer and member of the Republican Party, he
                    previously served as a representative and senator from
                    California and was the 36th vice president from 1953 to 1961
                    under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His five years in the
                    White House saw reduction of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam
                    War, d√©tente with the Soviet Union and China, the Apollo 11
                    Moon landing, and the establishment of the Environmental
                    Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health
                    Administration. Nixon's second term ended early when he
                    became the only U.S. president to resign from office, as a
                    result of the Watergate scandal.

                    Richard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913, in what
                    was then the township precinct of Yorba Linda, California,[5]
                    in a house built by his father, located on his family's lemon
                    ranch.[1][6][7] His parents were Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and
                    Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker, and his father
                    converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith. Through his
                    mother, Nixon was a descendant of the early English settler
                    Thomas Cornell, who was also an ancestor of Ezra Cornell,
                    the founder of Cornell University, as well as of Jimmy Carter
                    and Bill Gates.[8]

                    Nixon attended East Whittier Elementary School, where he
                    was president of his eighth-grade class.[16] His older
                    brother Harold had attended Whittier High School, which his
                    parents thought resulted in Harold's dissolute lifestyle,
                    before he contracted tuberculosis (that killed him in 1933).
                    They decided to send Nixon to the larger Fullerton Union
                    High School.[17][18] Though he had to ride a school bus
                    an hour each way during his freshman year, he received
                    excellent grades. Later, he lived with an aunt in Fullerton
                    during the week.[19] He played junior varsity football,
                    and seldom missed a practice, though he rarely was used in
                    games.[20] He had greater success as a debater, winning a
                    number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage
                    in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H.
                    Lynn Sheller. Nixon later mused on Sheller's words,
                    "Remember, speaking is conversation...don't shout at
                    people. Talk to them. Converse with them."[21] Nixon said
                    he tried to use a conversational tone as much as possible.

                    Nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend Harvard
                    University, but with Harold's continued illness requiring
                    his mother's care, Richard was needed at the store. He
                    remained in his hometown, and enrolled at Whittier College
                    in September 1930. His expenses at Whittier College were
                    met by his maternal grandfather.[1][23] Nixon played for
                    the basketball team; he also tried out for football, and
                    though he lacked the size to play, he remained on the team
                    as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm.[24]
                    Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had
                    literary societies. Nixon was snubbed by the only one
                    for men, the Franklins, many of whom were from prominent
                    families, unlike Nixon. He responded by helping to found
                    a new society, the Orthogonian Society.[25] In addition
                    to the society, his studies, and work at the store,
                    Nixon engaged in several extracurricular activities;
                    he was a champion debater and hard worker.[26] In 1933,
                    he engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier
                    police chief, but they broke up in 1935.[27]

                    After graduating from Duke University law school, Nixon
                    initially hoped to join the FBI. He received no response
                    to his letter of application, and learned years later that
                    he had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled
                    at the last minute due to budget cuts.[33] He returned to
                    California, was admitted to the California bar in 1937,
                    and began practicing in Whittier with the law firm Wingert
                    and Bewley.[28] His work concentrated on commercial
                    litigation for local petroleum companies and other
                    corporate matters, as well as on wills.[34] Nixon was
                    reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual
                    talk from women.[35] In 1938, he opened up his own branch
                    of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra, California,[36] and
                    became a full partner in the firm the following year.[37]
                    In later years, Nixon proudly said he was the only modern
                    president to have previously worked as a practicing
                    attorney.[35]
