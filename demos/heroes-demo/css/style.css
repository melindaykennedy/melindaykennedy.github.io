/* Before doing anything else, jump down to the HTML part of the demo and add
the code as directed. You'll need an HTML element to target before you start
writing CSS!

Then add the standard page layout setup below */

/* Next, we need to learn about background-image.

This is a CSS property that lets you add an image to an HTML element's 
background (duh) instead of a background color or gradient.

This property uses a weird function syntax similar to linear-gradient() 
but this one is called url().

Similar to the src attribute of an image, we need to provide a file path to 
the image we want to load.

As a reminder, a file path basically is a set of directions to the computer,
telling it how to get from where the code is to where the file we want to 
access is.

HOWEVER, there's one problem when we spcified the src attribute from index.html,
that file was in the root of our project folder.

All we had to provide was something like "images/image-to-load.jpg", it won't work,
because it's looking for a file at "css/images/image-to-load.jpg".

Instead we need a way to tell the CSS file to look OUTSIDE of it's current folder "css"
in order to find the "images" folder.

This is done by including something really weird-looking in teh file path "../"

This "../" says "go outside of the current folder".

So our actual file path that we'll provide to url() is "../images/image-to-load.jpg".

#hero-1 {
    background-image: url(../images/lizard.jpg);
    height: 100vh;
}

/* 

However, that still seems like it didn't work, WHY?

Well it actually did but we just have an empty div in our HTML right now which has 
a height of 0px.

The background image takes up no space on its own unlike the <img> element.

Imageine that we're wallpapering the image onto the background of our div.

So to actually see the background we need to increase the size of our hero div.

We'll make it a big one: we'll have it fill up 100% of the view height by using
100vh (vh is a unit short for "view height".
