        <p>Melinda Kennedy is my name...</p>
        <p>Figuring out my life is my game</p>
        <p>I've started a new chapter of my life</p>
        <p>By starting a new career, oh what strife</p>
        <p>My SO and I have been together for 10 years</p>
        <p>We have had lots of laughs but also shed some tears.</p>
        <p>He's my rock, my heart and one is our souls.</p>
        <p>We share dreams, ideas, life and goals.</p>
        <p>I love my current job and never want to leave</p>
        <p>But I have hopes, fears and I have a dream</p>
        <p>To one day become more than I am right now</p>
        <p>Maybe start a blog, write a book, or travel to Macau</p>
        <p>I am not sure where to start or how to make my dreams come true</p>
        <p>But I will rock this shit, through and through</p>
